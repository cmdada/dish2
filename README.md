# dish
Discord shell - run CLI commands from Discord (security is not guaranteed)

## Usage

### Installation
```shell
go install github.com/pythonian23/dish@latest
```

### Configuration
1. Create a `.dish`/`.toml` file
(the file extension does not matter; use `.dish` for clarity, `.toml` for easy syntax highlighting, 
and anything else if you really want to do so)

2. Figure it out yourself (check out an example at [example/example.dish](/example/example.dish))

3. Run dish: `dish -d <path to .dish file>`

4. Enjoy having a security hole
